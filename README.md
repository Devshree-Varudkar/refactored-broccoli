üöÄ Completed an Exciting Data Analysis Challenge! üöÄ

I'm thrilled to share that I recently participated in a challenge organized by Codebasics, where I analyzed election data from 2014 and 2019. This experience allowed me to dive deep into the dataset, uncover trends, and draw meaningful insights.

üîç Key Highlights of the Analysis:

Voter Turnout: Comparison of voter turnout between the two election years.
Winning Margins: Analysis of the changes in winning margins across different constituencies.
Party Performance: Trends in the performance of major political parties.
Demographic Influence: Impact of demographics on election outcomes.
This challenge not only honed my data analysis skills but also provided valuable insights into the electoral process and trends.

A big thank you to Codebasics for organizing this challenge and providing such an insightful dataset!
